This simple script recursively removes all node_modules folders inside a directory from which it was run.

## How to use
1. Put `bye-node_modules.sh` inside your projects directory;
1. Using `chmod u+x bye-node_modules.sh` make the script executable;
1. Run `./bye-node_modules.sh` from your projects directory every time, when you want to clean up the mess.
